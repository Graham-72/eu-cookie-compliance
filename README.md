# EU Cookie Compliance

The EU Cookie Compliance module enables a website to meet the
requirements of the EU Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications
regarding the use of cookies.

If a website makes use of cookies other than for the temporary storage of
data while a transaction is in progress, the user must be informed and
given the opportunity to decline the use of cookies. The site must also
include an explanation of the cookies that are used.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name. 

##How it works.

The module displays a pop-up at the bottom or at the top of pages to make 
users aware of the fact that cookies are being set. The user may then give 
his/her consent or move to a page that provides more details. Consent is given 
by the user pressing the agree button or by continuing to browse the website. 
Once consent is given another pop-up appears with a thank you message.

The module provides a settings page where the pop-up can be customised. There 
are also template files for the pop-ups that can be overridden by your theme. 

## Status

This is an initial incomplete port of the module.
